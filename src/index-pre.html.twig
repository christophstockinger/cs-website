              Currently I am working as a Software Developer with a focus on frontend development at the startup <a class="cAnker" href="https://www.easy2parts.com">Easy2Parts</a> in Deggendorf.
              <br>Before that, I worked as a web developer at <a class="cAnker" href="https://www.strichpunkt-design.de">Strichpunkt Design</a> in Stuttgart for clients such as the German Football Association and DHL.
              <br>I also successfully completed my studies at <a class="cAnker" href="https://www.th-deg.de">Deggendorf Institute of Technology</a> at the beginning of 2019. My thesis was about a technical translation of a brand architecture into a digital UI kit.
              <br>I also work as a freelance web developer for my label <a class="cAnker" href="http://www.coding77.de">Coding77</a> and Digital Designer.

            During my studies I was able to extend my self-learned knowledge in HTML, (S)CSS, ES6 (Javascript) and PHP (Laravel-Framework). In relation with my job career and my own projects I learned how to use Webpack, NodeJS, VueJs and Twig. In addition I was able to extend my knowledge in different CMS systems like Wordpress, October CMS, CraftCMS.
            <br>In addition, I have acquired sound knowledge for the creation of a UI kit (with the Fractal Framework) according to the Atomic Design Principle of Brad Frost.'
